# Server

A simple Node.js server that serves the built Angular application and can be installed as a Windows service.

## Server Structure

### Core Files

- `server.js` - Express server that serves the Angular app

  - Serves static files from `dist/scripts-dashboard/browser`
  - Routes all paths to `index.html` for Angular routing
  - Runs on port 4200 by default

- `service.js` - Windows service configuration using node-windows

  - Service name: "Angular Service"
  - Manages the server.js script as a Windows service
  - Handles service installation/uninstallation

- `daemon/` folder is auto generated by the service keeping the logs , errors and exe

## Usage

npm run start:service
```

will handle building the app + starting the service

The service will:

- Start automatically on system boot
- Restart on failure (max 10 retries)
- Have a 10-second wait time between restarts
